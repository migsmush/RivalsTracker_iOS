# RivalsTracker_iOS

A tool to help you track your stats in Marvel Rivals

Search and follow any profile to keep track of rank progression and gain insights on your best heroes and maps.

You can compare two profiles to see how you stack up against your friends.

Use the Scanner tool to snap a photo of the opposing team while loading up for a match to see what you're up against. The scanner should help you decide which hero you should pick to give you the most favorable matchups and maximize your odds of victory.
